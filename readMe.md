It was my final project from the one semester Johns Hopkins/Coursera web developer course.<br>
This was a major project.  The teacher provided the photos of the food and also walked me step by step through what to write for the CSS.<br>
The hard part, where I was really on my own, was writing the JS/AJAX to populate the menus.  That was sort of like serving a static to do list.
